# Hotel Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project involves analyzing hotel booking data from the years 2018, 2019, and 2020 to derive insights on revenue, customer behavior, and operational metrics. The analysis was conducted using MySQL, and various SQL queries were employed to extract and compute the required information.

## Databases and Tables
The data is stored in the `hotel_data` database, which contains the following tables:
- `bookings_2018`
- `bookings_2019`
- `bookings_2020`
- `market_segment`

## Analysis and Insights

### 1. Total Revenue by Year
The analysis calculates the total revenue generated each year by summing the Average Daily Rate (ADR) multiplied by the total nights stayed, excluding canceled bookings. This helps in understanding the yearly revenue trends and identifying the years with the highest revenue generation.

### 2. Average Lead Time by Market Segment
The average lead time, which is the number of days between booking and arrival, is computed for different market segments. This insight helps in understanding the booking behavior of customers from different market segments, which can aid in targeted marketing and sales strategies.

### 3. Cancellation Rate by Year
The cancellation rate for each year is calculated as a percentage of total bookings. This metric is crucial for identifying trends in booking cancellations and can help in formulating strategies to reduce cancellations and improve booking stability.

### 4. Revenue by Meal Type
The total revenue generated from different meal types is calculated. This helps in understanding which meal types are most popular and generate the most revenue, aiding in menu planning and food service strategies.

### 5. Average Daily Rate (ADR) by Year and Market Segment
The average daily rate is computed for each year and market segment. This analysis helps in understanding the pricing trends and how different market segments respond to pricing strategies over the years.

### 6. Total Special Requests by Year
The total number of special requests made by guests each year is summed. This insight helps in understanding customer preferences and needs, which can improve customer service and satisfaction.

### 7. Discounted Revenue by Market Segment
The total revenue after applying discounts for different market segments is calculated. This helps in understanding the impact of discount strategies on revenue generation and the effectiveness of discounts in attracting different market segments.

### 8. Average Stay Duration by Year
The average duration of stays each year is calculated. This metric helps in understanding customer stay patterns and can aid in optimizing booking strategies and improving customer retention.

### 9. Revenue from Repeated Guests
The revenue generated from repeated guests who did not cancel their bookings is calculated. This analysis helps in understanding the loyalty of customers and the contribution of repeated guests to the overall revenue.

## Conclusion
This project involved comprehensive analysis of hotel booking data over three years. The insights derived from the SQL queries help in understanding revenue trends, customer behavior, and operational efficiency. These insights can aid in strategic decision-making for improving hotel performance and customer satisfaction. By leveraging these insights, the hotel can optimize its operations, enhance customer experience, and drive revenue growth.
